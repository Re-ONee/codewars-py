## Removing Elements

Take an array and remove every second element out of that array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

**Example**

```python
my_list = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

## Given Code

```python
def remove_every_other(my_list):
    pass
```

## Solution

```python
def remove_every_other(my_list):
    return my_list[::2]
```
